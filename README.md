## Introduction

There's a lot of stuff out there written about React on Rails. 
> Most of it is garbage. 

We're going to build out our project as a [Rails 5 api](), and use [Webpack]() 
to build out React into Rails's `public` folder. 

### Advantages
✅ does NOT use Rails' asset pipelines
✅ does NOT use Create React App.
✅ 


## 1. Get started
